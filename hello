Hello!

As a candidate for the technical director position, I'd like to give you a simple programming test. Please spend about an hour on it, and turn it in as soon as possible as we want to hire someone soon.

Programming challenge:

Write a PHP Program that reads a text file, counts the occurrence of certain words ('dog', 'cat', 'jump') in the text file, and then outputs a list of the words next to the number of occurrences in the text file

(Example:
Dog 5
Cat 4
Jump 4)

You can turn it in by emailing me the php file, or preferably, putting the file on github.

Because of your late application to the position, I would recommend completing the test within the day.
